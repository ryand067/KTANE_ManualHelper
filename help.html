                <h2>Overall</h2>
                <p>Overall, the Bomb-Game Manual Helper is split into 2 halves; the left half and the right half.</p>
                <p>The left half is further broken down to the main, original Bomb-Game Manual found <a href="https://bombmanual.com/web/index.html" target="_blank">Here</a>, Appendixes, and the Modded Mods Section.</p>
                <p>The Modded Mods section is split further into 2 halves, just for easier finding.</p>
                <p>The right Half contains helper modules for the origainal modules that come with the game. These contain: <i>Memory, Sequence of Wires, and Complicated Wires</i>.</p>
                <p>There is a big yellow &quot;Clear&quot; button at the bottom of the right section. This is used to clear the page entirely. It clears all text, responses, and collapses all collapsable data.</p>
                <p>To use a module helper in the Modded Mods section or to see a Table in Appendix A: Tables, click on the text next to the Orange Arrows. They look like this: &nbsp; <img src="images/rightArrow.png" class="clickableArrows"></p>
                <p>To collapse a section, just click on the text next to the orange arrow that looks like this: &nbsp; <img src="images/closeArrow.png" class="clickableArrows"></p>
                <br>
                <h2>Memory</h2>
                <p>This Module-Helper is used for the <i>Memory</i> Module from the original game.</p>
                <p><b>Reason: </b>The reason this is a helper module is because it can be hard to remember all of the different numbers and positions for each step. This helper-module seeks to help with that issue.</p>
                <h3>How to use</h3>
                <p>To use this module, start with the first step. Whatever the number pressed was, record that in the text-area first, followed by whatever position that number was in without spaces, then press &quot;Enter&quot;.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> If the instructions say for step 1 press the button in the 2nd position, you'd ask the diffuser what button is in the 2nd position. Let's pretend it is the number 4. In this example, you'd input the number 42 into the text-area, and press enter. Because the 4 in 42 represents the number pressed and the 2 in 42 represents the 2nd position.</p>
                <p>Keep on doing this for all steps. If you need to look back to see what you pressed in the 2nd stage, for example, just look at the 2nd 2-digit number and relay the information to your diffuser.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Sequence of Wires</h2>
                <p>This Module-Helper is used for the <i>Sequence of Wires</i> Module from the original game.</p>
                <p><b>Reason: </b>The reason this is a helper module is because it can be hard to remember all of the different number of each colored wire. This helper-module seeks to help with that issue.</p>
                <h3>How to use</h3>
                <p>To use this helper-module, everytime the diffuser tells you what color wire they see, press the increase button to the right of that color's text-field. This will automatically increase the number which is 0 by default.</p>
                <p>That way, before you look at the table in the original manual section, you look at the text-field for that particular wire to see what number of that colored wire you are on.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> For example, if you currently have 3 for red, 2 for blue, and 1 for black, and the user tells you they have a black wire that goes to C, you would press the up arrow to the right of the black text-field. This will increase the black number to 2. Now, you will look at the original bomb-game manual and see if the manual says to cut the second black wire or not and relay the information back to your diffuser.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Password Helper</h2>
                <p>This Module-Helper is used for the <i>Password</i> Module from the original game.</p>
                <p><b>Reason: </b>The reason this is a helper module is because sometimes it can be hard to look through the big list of valid passwords in enough time. This way, You enter a few letters and all possible valid passwords appear instantly.</p>
                <h3>How to use</h3>
                <p>Start typing in the first few letters of a password you think might work. A list of valid passwords with the same prefix will appear. If the password you're thinking of isn't in the list, then it's not a valid password. Otherwise, it is and continue to guess more letters.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Complicated Wires</h2>
                <p>This Module-Helper is used for the <i>Complicated Wires</i> Module from the original game.</p>
                <p><b>Reason: </b>The reason this is a helper module is because it can be hard to interpert that massive venn-diagram on the original manual; which can be bad when under a very tight time constraint. This helper-module seeks to help with that issue.</p>
                <h3>How to use</h3>
                <p>The user will tell you a wire complication. For example, <i>a plain white wire with a star, but no L.E.D.</i></p>
                <p>Find this information in the table and look at the letter. Using the 2nd table, relay the information to your diffuser.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Addition</h2>
                <p>This is a modded module. It doesn't come with the original game. The original Manual can be found <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Addition.html" target="_blank">Here</a>.</p>
                <h3>How to use</h3>
                <p>In the addition module, there will always be 10 numbers to sum together. The text-area is designed to fit exactly 10 numbers with no scroll bar. If you see a scroll bar, you have inputted too many numbers.</p>
                <p>The diffuser will read you each number one at a time. Type all ten numbers into this text-area. When all 10 numbers have been entered, press the &quot;GO&quot; button below.</p>
                <p>If you see an error message in the result box, you have inputted a non-number, try again re-entering all numbers. If all numbers were inputted correctly, it should tell you the sum. Relay this answer to your diffuser.</p>
                <br>
